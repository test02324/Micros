Mars Rover Test

The attached is the source code.

The entire application source is contained in the /src directory.

It has been compiled against JDK v1.6. No additional libraries should be necessary to compile and run the source code.

In addition there are some unit tests in the /test directory. These require JUnit 4 to run (tested with v4.11).

The source code for the class to run the application is in /src/excercise/Main.java. This expects the commands to pass to the program to have as a command line argument a string containing commands to pass to the rover.

After the program is run, the output consists of a description of the final position, and heading of the rover.
